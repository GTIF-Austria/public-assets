**Comparison of grid capacities and renewable energy potentials**

This map allows for comparing applicable **energy potentials for photovoltaics (PV) and wind power** with the reported **distribution grid capacities**, depicted at the level of about 400 Austrian substation districts. Data on energy potentials include the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\) and the technical potential. Reported grid data inform on the current use (booked capacity) and the available free capacities, as reported on [Verfügbare Netzanschlusskapazitäten \- EbUtilities](https://www.ebutilities.at/verfuegbare-netzanschlusskapazitaeten) (status: 15 January 2026).

The map contains information on the following parameters: 

* **Grid Capacity** for corresponding substations, in MVA  
* **Capacity (C):** Installed capacity of PV wind power plants, in MWel  
* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by PV and wind power plants in GWhel per year

**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility. Realisable potentials are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).

The map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).
