**Electricity Generation Technologies and their Potential**

Energy potential for **photovoltaics** **(PV)** and **wind power** for the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\) and the technical potential at regional level, depicted at the level of Austrian administrative districts.

The map contains information on following parameters: 

* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by PV and wind power plants in GWhel per year  
* **Demand Share (DS):** Indicating how the annual electricity generation potential relates to electricity demand, expressing the share in corresponding final electricity demand in %.   
* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from PV and wind power plants, in EUR per MWhel  
* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that PV and/or wind producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel

**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility. For **electricity demand in 2030 and 2040** a growth of electricity consumption has been assumed that reflects decarbonisation efforts in industry, buildings and transport, causing a shift from fossil fuels towards electricity.

Realisable potentials for 2030 and 2040 as well as other parameter are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).

The map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).

The underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).
