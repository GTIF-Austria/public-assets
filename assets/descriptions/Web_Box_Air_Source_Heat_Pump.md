**Ambient Heat Potential for Air-Source Heat Pumps**

Ambient heat potential for air-source heat pumps in Austria for current status (2023), future projection (2030 & 2040\) and the technical potential at LAU 2 level.

The map contains information on following parameters: 

* **Energy (E)**: Annual ambient heat supplied to air-source heat pumps, in GWh per year  
* **Capacity (C)** Installed heating capacity of heat pumps, in MWth  
* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Cost per unit of delivered heat to heating systems, in EUR per MWhth  
* **Market Value (MV):** Reference costs of the technology in EUR per MWhth

**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility.

Realizable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).

The map includes both **potentials without climate change effects** (WOCC) and variations under a **medium climate change scenario** (RCP4.5), referred to as MOCC.
