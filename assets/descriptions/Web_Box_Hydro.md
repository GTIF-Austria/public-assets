**Energy Potential for Hydropower**

Energy potential for hydropower for the current status (2024) and the technical potential in future years at regional level, depicted at the level of catchment areas of Austria’s river basin.

The map contains information on following parameters: 

* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by hydropower in GWhel per year  
* **Capacity (C)** Installed capacity of hydropower, in MWel  
* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from hydropower, in EUR per MWhel  
* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that hydropower producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel

**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. These technical potentials are provided at defined ranges, i.e., from Low to High, to reflect the underlying uncertainty in identifying the technical potentials.

The map includes potentials that **acknowledge the impact of climate change in future years (2040, 2070\)**, assuming either **moderate climate change (RCP4.5 \- MOCC)** or **strong climate change effects (RCP8.5 – STCC)**.
