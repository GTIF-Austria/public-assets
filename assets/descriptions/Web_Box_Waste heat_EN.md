Potential from Excess Heat

Potential from excess heat (direct utilization and utilization via heat pumps) in Austria as technical potential for 2030 and 2040 at the LAU 2 level. 

The map contains information on following parameters: 

* **Energy (E):** Annual excess heat supplied directly to heating systems (direct utilization) or annual excess heat supplied to heat pumps, in GWh per year  
* **Capacity (C):** Installed heating capacity of heat pumps, in MWth  
* **Market Value (MV)**: Reference costs of the technology in EUR per MWhth

**Technical potential** **for 2030 and 2040** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential**, which considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility, has not been evaluated due to the lack of reliable market data.

Technical potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).

The map includes potentials without considering climate change effects (WOCC).
