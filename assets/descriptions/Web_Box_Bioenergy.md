**Technical Energy Potential for Biomethane Production**

Future projections of the technical potential for biomethane production in Austria at the LAU 2 level.

The map contains information on the annual amount of produced biomethane (**Energy \- E)**, in GWh per year.

**Technical potential for 2030 and 2040** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential**, which considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility, **has not been evaluated**.

The data includes **potentials without the effects of climate change (WOCC)**.
