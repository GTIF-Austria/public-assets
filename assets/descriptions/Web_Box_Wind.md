**Energy Potential for Wind**

Energy potential for wind power plants for the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\) and the technical potential at regional level, depicted at the level of Austrian administrative districts.

The map contains information on following parameters: 

* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by wind power plants in GWhel per year  
* **Capacity (C)** Installed capacity of wind power plants, in MWel  
* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from wind power plants, in EUR per MWhel  
* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that wind producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel

**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility.

Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).

The map includes **potentials without the effects of climate change (WOCC)**, with **moderate climate change (RCP4.5 \- MOCC)** and **strong climate change effects (RCP8.5 – STCC)**.
