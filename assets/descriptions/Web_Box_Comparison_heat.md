**Heating Technologies and their Potential**

Energy potentials from **solar thermal energy**, **air-source heat pumps**, **aquathermal energy, ground-source heat pumps** (open and closed systems), and **excess heat** (direct utilization and utilization via heat pumps) in Austria for the current status (2023), future projections (2030 & 2040), and the technical potential at LAU 2 level.

The map contains information on **annual heat supplied to heating systems**, in GWh per year (**Energy)**

**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility.

Realizable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).

The map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).

The underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).
